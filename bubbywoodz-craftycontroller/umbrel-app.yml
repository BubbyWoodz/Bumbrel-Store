  Crafty Controller is a free and open-source Minecraft server control panel.
  It allows you to create, manage, and monitor multiple Java and Bedrock servers
  from a web-based dashboard. Features include console access, file editing,
  backups, player management, and more.

  Note: After installation, access the panel and disable HTTPS in settings (or edit config.json: "https": false) for full compatibility with Umbrel's app proxy.
  Minecraft server ports (30000-30100) are exposed; ensure no conflicts. Dynmap and Bedrock ports are dynamically assigned—check app details.
