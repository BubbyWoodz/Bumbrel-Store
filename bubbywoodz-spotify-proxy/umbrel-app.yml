  Spotify Proxy is a lightweight, self-hosted backend for securely refreshing Spotify API access tokens using your own credentials.


  It was designed to integrate seamlessly with tools like [homepage.dev](https://github.com/benphelps/homepage), enabling beautiful, secure Spotify widgets on your custom dashboard.


  Just plug in your credentials once, and let Spotify Proxy handle access token rotation behind the scenes.


  🎧 Perfect for homepage.dev Spotify widgets

  
  🔐 Keeps your `client_secret` safe from the frontend

  
  🔄 Automatically refreshes and returns Spotify access tokens


  🧩 Easy integration with any dashboard, app, or project that uses Spotify's Web API


  🏠 Built for privacy and local control
